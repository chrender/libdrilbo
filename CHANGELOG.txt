   Version 0.2.1
 + 0.2.1 was finished at about (?).
 - Fixed missing "override" statments for CFLAGS in Makefiles.
 - Fixed $(DESTDIR) evaluation in config.[default|macports].mk.
 - Adapted Makefiles and configuration to use standard GNU Makefile variables
   instead of INSTALL_PATH and FIZMO_BIN_DIR.
 - Removed "drilbo-x11.c" requirement for "Xatom.h".

   Version 0.2.0
 + 0.2.0 was finished at about Sun Sep 18 08:41:18 CEST 2011
 + The "drilbo" library -- "Drilbo Represents an Imaging Libary not only for
   Blorb Objects" -- is supposed to handle fizmo's graphical related tasks.
   It makes fizmo's version 0.6 requirement for GTK obsolete, it directly
   uses libjpg and libpng to load images and provides its own Xlib
   implementation for X11 output (curentrly only supporting TrueColor).
 - Implemented support for reading jpeg, png and MG1 graphics, the latter
   one using code from Mark Howell's pix2gif tool from the ztools package.
 - Implemented output of jpeg (RGB, Grayscale and JCS_YCbCr) and ppm files
   in the P6 variant (usually only useful for debugging, P3 variant
   available, see code).
 - Implemented output to X11 displays though xlib, truecolor only.
 - Added support for bilinear scaling.
 - Implemented a "z_image" type which holds all the data and metadata for
   images. A z_image may contain either an RGB or a grayscale file with a
   depth of 8 bit per pixel.
